# Twitch Lib Sample

I haven't used twitchlib before, so put this together based on their example to try and explain what pieces are doing. 

- Disconnects events from TwitchLib Client itself to the application you put it in
- You could just wrap up the code inside the sample Bot and conenct directly to twitch lib events 

This is not intended as a best practices, or good design
